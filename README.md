🌾 AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA
📌 Project Overview
AgriData Explorer is a data analytics project that explores and visualizes Indian agricultural data to uncover insights on crop production trends across states and years. The project helps understand how different crops perform over time and across regions, supporting data-driven decision making in agriculture.
The analysis focuses on major crops such as Rice, Wheat, Sugarcane, Oilseeds, Millets, Sunflower, Groundnut, Soybean, and Sorghum, using interactive and static visualizations.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze crop production trends across Indian states
Identify top-producing states for major crops
Study long-term production patterns (last 50 years)
Compare crop production and yield efficiency
Store and retrieve processed data using MySQL
Create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly
Interactive dashboards and reports that highlight key agricultural insights.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and analysis
Matplotlib – Static visualizations
Plotly Express – Interactive dashboards
MySQL – Data storage
SQLAlchemy & PyMySQL – Database connectivity
POWERBI - Data visualizations
